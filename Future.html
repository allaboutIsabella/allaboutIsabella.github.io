	<h2>About Me</h2>
	
	<h2>High School</h2>
	<p>I can not believe I will be going to highschool next year. I have already sent in my application and now I am just waiting to see what the results are. I have applied to CAMS, Wilson, and Millikan. If i got accepted into CAMS, it would be amazing. My sister goes there and i just love the atmosphere and campus. The school is amazing and so are the people there. Everyone is just so friendly and willing to help one another with homework and anything else that they might need. I would say that I am excited to go to high school because it is a fresh start. I will get to meet new people and try new and harder subjects that I think I will enjoy. 
 </p>
	
	<h2>Career Interests</h2>
	<p>My career interests consist of anything that has to do with animals. I am interested in Marine Biology but I would also like to work with helping to fix animals. I do like veterinarians because they get to be able to save all types of animals. My other choice would to be a zoologist because I love the animals at the zoo and I would like to be able to help them and learn to be friends with them. My dream job would be zookeeper. Ever since I was little I remember telling my mom that I wanted to be where the zookeeper was. I wanted to feed the animals, play with them, and just be friends with them. They are such beautiful creatures and I hope that one day I can be a zookeeper.</p>
	
	<h2>College</h2>
	<p>College is a few years away. At the moment I am really not sure what college I would like to go to but I have a few ideas. UCLA is a wonderful school and they have a lot of biology pathways. What I am looking for in a school would have to be what I want to do which is Marine biology or zoology. Also the campus has to be comfortable or I am probably not going to feel at home if I go there. </p>
	
	<h2>My Goals in Life are to...</h2>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
	Be successful
	    </li>
	</ol>
I want to be able to have a good job that makes a reasonable amount of money so that I can buy a house or an apartment to live in. Being successful also means to be able to provide for myself with food and clothes.
	<ol>
		<li>
      Have a job that I love
	    </li>
	</ol>
There is no point in having a job that you do not love because then you are just miserable. You do not always have to get the perfect job right away. I mean you do have to work for it but eventually we can all get to our dream job.
	<ol>
		<li>
      Keep in touch with friends and make new ones
	    </li>
	</ol>
When we all go to college and high school most of us drift away from each other. I have seen it happen to my sister and I know that it will probably happen eventually but I hope that at least we will be able to see each other and hang out every once in awhile. The important thing is to make new friends as well. Wherever we go we should be able to have friends so that we have someone to talk to. I look forward to going to high school because I get to make new friends.
