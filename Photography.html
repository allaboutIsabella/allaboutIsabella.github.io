	<h1>My World</h1>

	<h2>About Me</h2>
	
	<h2>Family</h2>
	<p>I come from a medium sized family I would say, my Mom, Dad, Sister, and all the other crazy family members that I love.
My dad's side of the family is hispanic while my mom's side is Native American. My family is amazing! My sister is currently a senior in high school and next year she is going to college. My mom is an adult teacher and my dad is a plumber. I love my family, they have tought me so much that i will remember for years to come.
 </p>
	
	<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
	<p>In my free time I like to do a lot of different things. Some of my favorites are skateboarding, biking, playing soccer or really any kind of sport, and lastly I love Photography. To me photography shows the beauty of living things or even the world that we capture and remember. I see photography as the beauty of nature. Sometimes i just sit outside or ride my bike and look for things, plants, and animals to take pictures of.  </p>
	
	<h2>Skills</h2>
	<p> Some of my favorite skills that I have are coding, using sketchup, 3D Designing, and typing. My ability to type is very important to me because I started out in 6th grade typing at a speed of 10 words per minute at the most. Now I am in 8th grade and I type close to 80 words per minute. Looking back, I can never see myself typing anything less than 60 words per minute.</p>
	
	<h2>What are my Intrests?</h2>
<p>My biggest intrest are animals. Animals are so intresting to just watch and learn about. They really do just fascinate me. I hope that in the future I have a job working with any kind of animal, birds, marine animals, land animals, and even insects. Yes, I said insects. Ants, leaf bugs, spiders...some spiders, they are a little creepy.</p>
