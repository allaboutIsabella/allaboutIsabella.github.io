	<h1>Inspiration</h1>

		<article>
		<p>My love of photography started with inspiration. I always kept seeing these beautiful pictures online of landmarks, the ocean
		and animals. Then sometimes when I would travel around with my family, I would see these people with tripods standing by cliffs or infront of signs
		and just taking pictures. So I said to myself, I want to be one of those people who have their pictures online, I want to be able to be
		the person whos pictues bring light into others, but there was only one problem...I didn't have a camera. I asked my dad if we could get an actual camera
		and my wish came true. Today whenever we travel of just go outside I always have my camera. The more pictures I take,
		the more I impress my family and bring a smile to their faces. The pictures that you will see below are one that I have taken myself on a trip to Flordia's Disney World, Epcot, and Animal Kingdom.</p>
