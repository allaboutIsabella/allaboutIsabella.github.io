	<h2>The ATM Program</h2>

	<h2>What does ATM Stand for?</h2>
		<p>ATM stands for Applied Technology Magnet. It is a program at Bancroft Middle School that teaches a number of students about technology.
		The program is a 3 year contract starting in 6th grade. You will learn everything from typing to coding your very own website, kind of like the one your looking at right now.</p>
		
	
	<h2>6th Grade</h2>
	<p>If you chosen for the ATM program, you will begin to learn alot in your first year. 
		When I was a 6th grader I learned the following things:<br> </p>
		<p>
		-Typing<br>
		-Screencast<br>
		-Voiceovers<br>
		-Tagxedo<br>
		-How to use Microsoft Word, Excell, and Powerpoint<br>
		</p>
	<h2>7th Grade</h2>
	<p></p>
	
	<h2>Skills</h2>
	<p> Some of my favorite skills that I have are coding, using sketchup, 3D Designing, and typing. My ability to type is very important to me because I started out in 6th grade typing at a speed of 10 words per minute at the most. Now I am in 8th grade and I type close to 80 words per minute. Looking back, I can never see myself typing anything less than 60 words per minute.</p>
	
	<h2>What are my Intrests?</h2>
<p>My biggest intrest are animals. Animals are so intresting to just watch and learn about. They really do just fascinate me. I hope that in the future I have a job working with any kind of animal, birds, marine animals, land animals, and even insects. Yes, I said insects. Ants, leaf bugs, spiders...some spiders, they are a little creepy.</p>
