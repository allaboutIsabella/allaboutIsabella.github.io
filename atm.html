	<h2>Review</h2>
<p>If I could describe the ATM program in one word it would be AMAZING!!! The program has taught me so many things that I will use in my future. There have been times where i wish I could be in art class but when i think about it, I wouldnâ€™t change it for anything.The teachers Ms. Milton and Mrs. McClure are so amazing and caring. They have helped me and everyone else so well and they have been so kind and comforting. They are two of my favorite teachers here and if I could, I would stay in the ATM program.
